**Concepts of 1.BOW 2.TF-IDF 3.Word embeddings Intuition** 

---

### 🧱 1️⃣ Bag of Words (BoW)

**Idea:** Represent text as word counts.
✅ Converts words → numbers.
❌ Ignores:

* Word **order**
* **Meaning** or context
* Synonyms (e.g., “happy” and “joyful” are treated as totally different)

> Example:
> “I love badminton” → [love=1, badminton=1, I=1]
and
> “Badminton I love” → same vector!

---

### 📊 2️⃣ TF–IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency)

**Idea:** Still uses BoW as base, but weights words by how *important* they are.
✅ Highlights meaningful words (rare but important ones).
❌ Still ignores:

* Word **order**
* **Semantic meaning** (it doesn’t know “happy” ≈ “joyful”)

So it’s *not* about meaning similarity — it’s about **importance** of words in a document relative to others.

> TF-IDF just says:
> “How frequent is this word in this document, compared to the rest of the corpus?”

> So TF-IDF is a **weighted BoW**, not a semantic model.

---

### 🧠 3️⃣ Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText)

**Idea:** Learn **dense vector representations** for words based on **context**.
✅ Understands **semantic similarity**
✅ Words with similar meaning have **similar vectors** (e.g., “king” ≈ “queen”, “doctor” ≈ “nurse”)
✅ Captures some **syntactic** relationships (e.g., “walking” vs “walked”)
✅ Considers **context** through co-occurrence patterns
❌ Still does **not fully** consider long-range order of words (sentence structure)

> Word2Vec’s principle:
> “You shall know a word by the company it keeps.”
> If “bank” appears near “river” or “money”, model learns both senses.

So embeddings are **not next level of TF-IDF**,
they are a **completely different approach** — from count-based → to **neural, meaning-based** representation.

---

### 🧬 4️⃣ Sentence / Contextual Embeddings (BERT, GPT, etc.)

**Idea:** Modern transformer-based embeddings consider **meaning + context + order**.
✅ Knows full sentence meaning
✅ Understands that “I love apples” ≠ “Apples love me”
✅ Dynamic embeddings — same word can have different meanings based on context (polysemy)

So these are **beyond** word embeddings:
they give **context-aware representations** of entire sentences or paragraphs.

| Method                | Type            | Considers Order? | Captures Meaning? | Learns from Context? |
| --------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| BoW                   | Count-based     | ❌                | ❌                 | ❌                    |

Perfect 👏 Let’s make this hands-on and crystal clear!

We’ll take a few short sentences and compare how **BoW**, **TF-IDF**, and **Word2Vec** represent them numerically.

---

### 🧩 Step 1 — Sample Sentences

```python
sentences = [
    "I love playing badminton on weekends",
    "Badminton makes me happy and active",
    "Gardening is peaceful and relaxing",
    "I love dancing every weekend"
]
```

---

### 🧱 Step 2 — Bag of Words

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer

bow_vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
bow = bow_vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences).toarray()
print("BoW Feature Names:\n", bow_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print("\nBoW Matrix:\n", bow)
```

👉 You’ll see 0s and 1s (or counts).
Words are represented by position only — **no meaning, no order**.

---

### 📊 Step 3 — TF-IDF

```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer

tfidf_vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf = tfidf_vectorizer.fit_transform(sentences).toarray()
print("\nTF-IDF Feature Names:\n", tfidf_vectorizer.get_feature_names_out())
print("\nTF-IDF Matrix:\n", tfidf)
```

👉 Same features as BoW, but with floating-point **weights** based on importance.
Still **no semantic meaning** — just weighted counts.

---

### 🧠 Step 4 — Word Embeddings (Word2Vec)

Let’s train a small **Word2Vec** model to learn semantic vectors.

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

tokenized_sentences = [word_tokenize(s.lower()) for s in sentences]
w2v_model = Word2Vec(sentences=tokenized_sentences, vector_size=10, window=3, min_count=1, sg=1)

# View similar words
print("\nMost similar to 'badminton':", w2v_model.wv.most_similar('badminton'))
print("\nVector for 'badminton':\n", w2v_model.wv['badminton'])
```

👉 Now each word has a **dense vector (10 numbers)** that encode meaning.
Words with similar context get **closer** vectors — e.g.
`'badminton' ≈ 'dancing'`, `'peaceful' ≈ 'relaxing'`.

---

### 🧬 Step 5 — (Optional) Sentence Embeddings (Meaning of whole sentence)

If you want **sentence-level meaning**, you can use **BERT embeddings**:

```python
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
sentence_embeddings = model.encode(sentences)
print("\nSentence Embedding Shape:", sentence_embeddings.shape)
```

👉 Each sentence → 384-dimensional vector capturing **order, meaning, and context**.
E.g., sentences about *hobbies* will cluster together in vector space.
