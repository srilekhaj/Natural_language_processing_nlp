Perfect ‚úÖ Let‚Äôs make a clean **mini project summary** for your portfolio or documentation.
We‚Äôll call it:

## üß† **Project: News Topic Classification using Naive Bayes**

### üìò **Objective**

To automatically classify news articles into different topics (like *electronics*, *autos*, or *religion*) using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning**.

---

### üìä **Dataset**

**20 Newsgroups Dataset** ‚Äî a well-known text dataset from scikit-learn that contains thousands of newsgroup posts across 20 categories.
For this project, we‚Äôll use a subset:

```python
categories = ['sci.electronics', 'soc.religion.christian', 'rec.autos']
```

Each category represents a distinct topic.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Steps Involved**

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Libraries

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report
```

---

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Load Dataset

```python
categories = ['sci.electronics', 'soc.religion.christian', 'rec.autos']
train_data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='train', categories=categories)
test_data = fetch_20newsgroups(subset='test', categories=categories)
```

---

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Build TF-IDF + Naive Bayes Pipeline

```python
model = make_pipeline(TfidfVectorizer(), MultinomialNB())
model.fit(train_data.data, train_data.target)
```

---

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate the Model

```python
predicted = model.predict(test_data.data)
print(classification_report(test_data.target, predicted, target_names=test_data.target_names))
```

---

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Test with Custom Text

```python
sample_docs = [
    "I replaced my car engine and now it's running smoothly.",
    "Jesus is the son of God and we should have faith in Him.",
    "I am learning about resistors and capacitors for my circuit project."
]

predicted_categories = model.predict(sample_docs)

for doc, category in zip(sample_docs, predicted_categories):
    print(f"\nText: {doc}\nPredicted Topic: {train_data.target_names[category]}")
```

---

### üß© **Example Output**

```
Text: I replaced my car engine and now it's running smoothly.
Predicted Topic: rec.autos

Text: Jesus is the son of God and we should have faith in Him.
Predicted Topic: soc.religion.christian

Text: I am learning about resistors and capacitors for my circuit project.
Predicted Topic: sci.electronics
```

---

### üìà **Results**

* The model successfully classifies documents into their respective topics.
* Accuracy typically ranges between **85‚Äì95%** for this subset.
* Uses **TF-IDF features** to capture word importance and **Naive Bayes** for probabilistic classification.

---

### üí° **Key Learnings**

* Text preprocessing and TF-IDF vectorization.
* Building and evaluating a text classification pipeline.
* Understanding probabilistic models (Naive Bayes).
* Testing and interpreting NLP model predictions.
